# Peeragogy Handbook Version 4: Thoughts

> **jblaing**: What is the intended audience of the handbook?

We've discussed no less that four potential audiences:
Education, Business, Government, and Volunteer Groups

The changes and ideas relevant to each group can be discussed below.

Note: Let's also check this outline against the "next steps" listed in our [Roadmap](https://github.com/Peeragogy/peeragogy-workbook/blob/master/peeragogy-workbook.md#emergent-roadmap).

# Education

Many contributors to the project are teachers. **LauraRitchie** proposed a
new case study following up on 5PH1NX that would talk about stuff
she's done with her students.  What other changes would we want to
see?

# Business

**snowinla** often talks about the specific needs of people in
  business, and especially the need to keep things brief. What would
  the Peeragogy Handbook look like as an executive summary, or several
  short summaries?

# Government

An interesting general motivation is to keep the costs down.  Here's a
pie chart that shows how spending works currently (in the USA):

![Overall allocations in the US, from the National Priorities Project](https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/total_spending_pie%2C__2015_enacted.png)

From this chart, it stands to reason that cutting costs _in education_
is basically a drop in the bucket.  Our contributions to the FLOK
project were more broad reaching.  Can we get back to that?

# Volunteer Groups

This is where our collective experience in the Peeragogy project is
most relevant.

# General thoughts

**jblaing** and **antiface** have initiated an interesting discussion
  about notecards and reference cards.  That might relate to the
  keep-it-short motivation in the Business heading above.
  **daytripper** and **holtzermann17** talked about possibly turning
  much of the book into patterns (which would be similar).
