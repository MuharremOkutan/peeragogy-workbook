# Peeragogy Handbook

*Education*

> Support peers learning producing across the world by publishing the Peeragogy Handbook!

_I wonder if we should put "we're launching version 3.0 of the peeragogy handbook here on IndieGoGO so we can give buyers a low price."_

## Short Summary

Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:

- Introduce yourself and your background.
- Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.
- Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.

Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?

> I think we should start with a really succinct summary of the Handbook, point out that people can get the PDF, HTML or Markdown versions for free, and then summarize where a breakdown of money paid in (or donated) here will go.  We should work on that with the mailing list and others, but some ideas would be good...

## What We Need & What You Get

Break it down for folks in more detail:

- Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.
- Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!
- Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.

> Let's explain why buying a hard copy version of the book is a good idea.  We should also include the opportunity for people to buy more than one copy, e.g. 5-10-20-30 copies if they want to use it in a course or with a reading group.  We can offer some sort of Accelerator service for "premium" donors.

## The Impact

Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:

- Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.
- Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).
- Make it real for people and build trust.

> Let's explain a bit about current impact stories, e.g. our contribution of a brief for FLOK but also some information about current authors and the organizations that they are working with.

## Risks & Challenges

People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.

- Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.
- Describe your plan for solving these challenges.

> The main risk is just that we won't be able to get a very good bulk price if not that many people order the book this way.  But people will still be able to get a copy of the book.

## Other Ways You Can Help

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

- Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.
- Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!

> Yes, and of course they are also welcome to assist with the project in all the standard ways.

And that's all there is to it.
