# Core problems

> Backwards links specify the “larger” context for each of our patterns. This helps to explain the core problem that each pattern in our pattern language addresses. This table records each instance of B- ←A where pattern A refers to pattern B.

## Peeragogy: How can we solve problems together?

- ←Roadmap We need to figure out how to get from “here” to “there”.
- ←Carrying capacity Each contributor has bounded time and other resources.

## Roadmap: How can we keep track of what everyone is doing?

- ←Reduce, reuse, recycle A plan develops by making sense of existing resources.
- ←Carrying capacity As difficulties are encountered the plan should be revised.
- ←A specific project The project may cover many connected sub-projects.
- ←Wrapper Someone in the project needs to make sure the plan reflects reality.
- ←Newcomer If new participants have trouble getting involved, the plan should be revised.

## Reduce, reuse, recycle: How can we avoid undue isolation?

- ←Heartbeat As we notice new spin-off or spin-in projects, we can give them energy.
- ←Newcomer Each potential contributor brings a somewhat new approach.
- ←Scrapbook We can keep track of great ideas coming from many different sources.

## Carrying capacity: How can we avoid becoming overwhelmed?

- ←Reduce, reuse, recycle All available perspectives are useful for the project.
- ←A specific project We may need help to create or activate a plan.
- ←Wrapper Share skills and be transparent about limitations and bottlenecks.
- ←Heartbeat Project activites should give us rewards, not drain our energy.

## A specific project: How can we avoid becoming perplexed?

- ←Peeragogy We can collaborate on (the intersections of) specific projects.
- ←Roadmap In some cases we can lay out the potential tasks far in advance.
- ←Heartbeat We may alternate open discussion with focused work sessions.
- ←Newcomer As we find our way from motivation to action, we add concreteness.

## Wrapper: How can people stay in touch with the project?

- ←Roadmap If project participants are not all contributing, someone may take charge.
- ←Scrapbook One part of this responsible role is to gather outstanding concerns.

## Heartbeat: How can we make the project “real” for participants?

- ←Roadmap The simplest plan may just be to meet together from time to time.
- ←Wrapper It can be useful to set things up so that people can follow different
rhythms.

## Newcomer: How can we make the project accessible to new people?

- ←Roadmap Transparency can show outsiders what it would be like to get involved.
- ←Carrying capacity Boosting the project’s capacity may require training in new participants.
- ←Wrapper Ideally we would actively welcome all contributions with love.

## Scrapbook: How can we maintain focus as time goes by?

- ←Carrying capacity It is useful to record obstacles and outstanding challenges.
- ←A specific project We want to stay connected to concrete action, not just theory.
- ←Heartbeat A project that is no longer rewarding may be put on the back burner.

# Core solutions

> Forward links specify the “smaller” context for each of our patterns. This helps to explain the core solution that each pattern in our pattern language offers. This table records each instance of A→B where pattern A refers to pattern B.

## Peeragogy: Get really concrete about what the problems are.

- → A specific project The way to make progress is to get specific.

## Roadmap: Build a plan that we keep updating as we go along.

- → A specific project The project shouldn’t solve all problems.
- → Heartbeat People will meet in some rhythm.
- → Wrapper Someone should help those who are less involved keep apprised of progress.
- →Newcomer A good plan can help new people get involved.

## Reduce, reuse, recycle: Use what’s there and share what we make.

- →Roadmap Develop a plan to make sense of existing resources.
- →Carrying capacity Existing stresses are one resource that we can use.

## Carrying capacity: Clearly express when we’re frustrated.

- → Roadmap When problems and difficulties are made explicit they can eventually be
addressed.
- →Newcomer If there is too much work to do, finding people to help may be helpful.

## A specific project: Focus on concrete, doable tasks.
- →Roadmap Make your project even more specific by creating a concrete plan.
- →Carrying capacity Make the scope of the project match your available energy.
- →Scrapbook Make note of anything you haven’t been able to solve and move on.

## Wrapper: Maintain a coherent public surface.

- →Roadmap Part of your job is to draw out goals and methods that people are using.
- →Carrying capacity Make note of difficulties that the group encounters.
- →Newcomer Make the project accessible to newcomers.
- →Heartbeat Make sure that meetings happen and that reports on those meetings go to the right people.

## Heartbeat: Keep up a regular, sustaining rhythm.

- →Reduce, reuse, recycle You can set up spin-off projects when something gets
interesting.
- →Carrying capacity The group should nurture the people in the group.
- →A specific project Set up regular meetings to focus on specific tasks.
- →Scrapbook Wind down projects that are no longer helpful.

## Newcomer: Let’s learn from newcomers.

- →Roadmap A new person can give feedback on how clear the plan is.
- →A specific project Newcomers should adapt their general interest to a specific
task.

## Scrapbook: Move things that are not of immediate use out of focus.

- →Roadmap Just as we keep track of the future plans, we should also keep track of
past events.
- →Reduce, reuse, recycle Something that is not interesting right now may become
interesting later.
